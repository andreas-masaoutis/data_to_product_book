What Lean is about:

- Definition
lean manufacturing rested on a deep understanding of what creates value, why rapid flow is essential, and how to release the brainpower of the people doing the work.

Lean is a pull model, rather than a push one (toyota vs ford)

The question in not can we build that, but rather should we do so?

Many agile practices like short cycles, non-negotiable quality, regular retrospectives, pulling work from a "backlog," come from Lean.

In this book we hope to change the software development paradigm from process to people, from disaggregation to aggregation, from speculation to data-based decision making, from planning to learning, from traceability to testing, from cost-and-schedule control to delivering business value. Mary Poppendieck




(the project paradigm is based on the assumption that what we plan to build is the cprrect/valuable thing to do. at Amazon, for example, it is a common practice to evaluate every new feature, yet the success rate is below 50%. Online Experimentation at Microsoft. Kohavi at all. https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf)
## The biggest waste in software development is to build things that do not contribute value to the product
Building things that do not bring value is wasteful in 3 ways:
- The opportunity cost of not building something of value
- The maintenance cost for the zero value features, 
- plus the added complexity to the overall design that makes it more difficult to add valuable features

  

What we should do by Jez Humble 

don't optimise for the case where we are right, as most of the times the features that we plan to build do not bring value
focus on value instead of cost, since as Douglas Hubbard showed in The IT Measurement Inversion https://www.cio.com/article/274975/it-organization-the-it-measurement-inversion.html the single most important factor is whether a project will be cancelled and whether people will actually use it.
create feedback loops to validate assumptions
make it economics to work in small batches
enable and experimental approach to product development


- Doing your user research
  Two axis: quantitative vs qualitative and generative vs evaluative
  quantitative and generative: run a customer/product survey to find out about something related to your customers / products
  quantitative and evaluative: a/b testing, user/product analytics, key metrics
  qualitative and generative: Follow-Me-Home
  qualitative and evaluative: usability testing



What the Lean movement has used for years in process improvement, can be used in software engineering. This is possible because software, in contrast to, say, buildings, can be valuable even if not complete. 

The HP example

in order to change you need clearly defined and measurable goals, along with a well established experimental approach. Try X, assess whether it took you closer to your goal, recalibrate, and then rinse and repeat. This not only works for software, it also works for processes.



Eric Ries with the 'Lean Startup' did not just focus on the programmers but described cycles of learning for everybody that is involved in building software.
