===========

What Clean Code is about:

- Definition
- Main sources
- Central ideas

Note that the ideals below pertain to design more than enuthing else. Still they have synergies with clean code as an overall concept.
Five things that matter in making the code easy to change:
1.Modularity
2.Cohesion
3.Separation of concerns
4.Abstraction / information hiding
5.Loose coupling
