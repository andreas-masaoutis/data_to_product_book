Mastery, Autonomy & Purpose
To motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks, Pink believes that supporting employees in the following areas will result in increased performance and satisfaction:

    Autonomy – A desire to be self directed, it increases engagement over compliance.
    Mastery – The urge to get better skilled.
    Purpose – The desire to do something that has meaning and is important. Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with poor customer service and unhappy employees.[5]

One of the ways to organise the team is to have a set of broadly skilled people, that have collective ownership of the code and the product. Everyone can commit to the main which means they should be accountable. There are no separate groups of people that do the testing or maintain the infrastructure; the teams do that. And there is no layering of people and access to data.
Also these is no buffering between the business and the developers. The connection is immediate with the business and the product. There are no dedicated business analysts, product owners, or testers. these are all functions covered by the team members, and as a result there is no need for large teams 4-6 people is enough. Each team member does a certain amount of story research; they talk to the business and try to figure out what the needs are, and then they do the technical research on the available options, that will finally be presented to the rest of the team and stakeholders for decision to be made. The team's time is split between new story development, maintenance/technical improvement of the existing system. The teams are not entirely collocated and therefore there is the need for online boards to keep track of the work planned and done. All developers in the team can spent one day per week for learning, not necessarily on the immediate needs of the product. The team is tracking its activities, since there are no project managers to manage things around, so that the team can then inspect and adapt. With the retrospective the team has the 'ability' to decide what to track, how to measure the performance and what steps to take in order to improve. Collective ownership also extends to processes. The team makes things happen without relying onto any kind of specialist. The team does have specialists, but they are there to work with the teams and teach the teams. It's not a case of the specialist does a special thing. With cross-functional teams there are fewer bottlenecks. Additionally the teams are fluid with team members rotating between the various teams, every x number of months. In the end, 1. the teams deliver value in a sustainable manner, so that the management can be reassured that things do work without having to manage things closely. Also, 2. the teams build change tolerant systems that are easier to modify. Finally, 3. the choice over what to do, makes it easier for team members to relate to the business needs, it means that people acquire more skills of greater variety by constantly learning, that makes their work more fulfilling, and as a result they stick with the team for far longer.


The team is the locus of business problems, technical solutions, and organisational processes
