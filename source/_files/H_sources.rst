Engineering Software Products -  An Introduction to Modern Software Engineering, by Ian Sommerville, published by Pearson Education, 2020.
This is a great introductory book on Agile. Sommerville has authored one of the main academic textbooks on software engineering, titled 'Software Engineering', where the focus was on traditional projects and thereofore Agile techniques had been a mere reference. Instead, in his latest book, Sommerville has brought product development using Agile techniques at the center of attention. A must read as an academic introductory book.
