Introduction
============================


Hello there.

This piece of work aims at being sort of an introduction to sofware engineering - or in simple terms how software is being built. It is thought of as a one-stop solution to the question: how can I build a software application? Obviously, you cannot expect any zero-to-hero solution from a ebook - besides, it being offered for free, means there is no incentive for sales-increasing catch frases. What you have on your screen is nore like a manual or a practical introduction to the subject; a survey of themes on concepts, tools and processes that comprise software engineering.

Why would someone need such a book? Well, I can tell you how I felt the need for it. After being introduced to programming during my PhD studies, and having spent some years learning things, I started having the feeling that I need to pass to the next level: how do I build a complete software system? It is like learning any new language; it's one thing to learn it and completely another to compose an essay in that language. You need to know the language, but composing an essay is much more than just knowing the syntax. In a similat manner, after having learnt the fundamental concepts of programming, and the syntax in Python, and having worked with some libraries, and having built toy projects, it was about time to build something for real. I went through books and various online sources on software engineering, on specific topics and frameworks, on tools, but I would still be at a loss. How can I put all this together? How do people actually build software? That's what this book is about. An exposition of all the necessary preconditions, tools, processes that should posses and use in order to build a piece of useful real-word software.

Who could possibly benefit from the book? There are a couple of `personas` which would, hopefully, find this book useful:
   - A recent graduate from a computer science related program, than knows how to program and the fundamental of software engineering and would benefit from seeing how everything fits together. Possibly a final year student doing a final project that entails building an application.
   - A self-tought programmer, or an aspiring one, could get an idea of the array of concepts and tools that has to masterm in order to deliver an application.
   - An experienced software engineer leading a team, that won't learn anything new per se, but could use this as a source for helping junior colleagues get on-board and up to speed.
   - A manager responsible for a team of developers or an entrepreneur with an idea and the funds, but lacking the technical skills. Both would benefit from an understanding of the subject, when dealing with developers.
