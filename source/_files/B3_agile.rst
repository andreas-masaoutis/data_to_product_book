What Agile is about:

- Definition

in the end the test for true agility is continuous delivery

The practices, like XP, are what give content to the form of the processes, like Scrum.

Agile means different things to different people. Actually, it came about as a point of convergence for various practices like XP and Scrum. Therefore, the best we can do is rehash some of the background info available at the  page `Agile manifesto <https://agilemanifesto.org/>`_. There are many more detailed sources on that. We'll start with the Agile manifesto put forward in 2001

  Manifesto for Agile Software Development

  We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
  Through this work we have come to value:

  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

  That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Although this is short, there is a lot to unpack.



We can then interpret the Agile manifesto not as an 'a priori' argument against waterfall but rather as one about its suitability in the new conditions. It might have been ok to build software in that way for space missions in the past, but it is not suitable anymore in the kinds of projects we now have to deal with.


The signatories of the manifesto had already developed various ideas during the 1990's :
Sutherland and Schwaber had proposed scrum
Beck, Jeffries and Cunningham had developed the eXtreme Programming practices
Cockburn had proposed the Crystal family of methods
Beck had proposed the test first methods
Fowler had worked on Design patterns and refactoring
Martin had worked on patters and the concept of Clean Code

We can see that the manifesto is, in a sense, the common denominator of various practices that were circulating in the software engineering market at that time. Agile is what disciplined people had already been practicing in the wild 




Being agile is not about the title, is about the continuous effort to improve.

One of the manifestations of the lack of agility is that one needs to understand everything in the codebase in order to change anything, at which point what you have is rigidity rather than agility.
