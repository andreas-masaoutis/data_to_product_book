What Agile is about:

- Definition

Agile means different things to different people. Actually, it came about as a point of convergence for various practices like XP and Scrum. Therefore, the best we can do is rehash some of the background info available at the  page `Agile manifesto <https://agilemanifesto.org/>`_. There are many more detailed sources on that. We'll start with the Agile manifestp

  Manifesto for Agile Software Development

  We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
  Through this work we have come to value:

  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

  That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Although this is short, there is a lot to unpack
