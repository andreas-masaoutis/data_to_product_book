What Scrum is about:

Scrum is a process not an engineering methodology 

The central tenet of Scrum is to produce a Done increment in a sprint.

The definition of Done is actually defines the way the whole of the project moves on:

Dumb definition from a purely technical perspective
Pair programming
TDD
Refactoring 
user acceptance testing 
continuous integration ( unit, deployment, build, integration, and regression tests )
performance testing

Done definition from the product perspective 
Clean code base 
Valuable functionality only 
Architectural conventions respected 
according to design/style/usability guide 
Documented 
Service levels guaranteed



Main parts
Product backlog
Iteration 
valuable increment potentially releasable
feedback

Three artifacts
product backlog
sprint backlog
and done increment

Four events
sprint planning once per iteration
    - sprint goal
    - The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.
    - sprint plan: how the work is going to be done
    - 
daily scrum one per day
    - 15 minute meeting
    - what have we done, what we are going to do, impediments
    - actionable plan for the rest of the day
(backlog refinement) as necessary
    - during the sprint, and given the work done and the feedback that might arrive, the PO and possibly the team, elaborate the items of the product backlog, and the sprint backlog if necessary

sprint review once per iteration 
    - inspect the outcome
    - demonstrate the outcome
    - adjust product backlog

sprint retrospective
    - assess the work of the team
    - look for ways to improve quality and team effectiveness


In the end, if you adopt Scrum as a process, without the engineering methodology, it will not do much.
