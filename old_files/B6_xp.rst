eXtreme Programming
=======================

What eXtreme Programming is about:

Using test first, was a change in that the developer was taking full responsibility for the quality of the code, rather than just passing it over to the QA team.
In the end of the day everything is about thw working program. 

Beck uses the triad values, principles, practices to explain XP.
values:
communication
simplicity 
feedback 
courage 
respect

principles:
incremental improvement 
principle of flow 

practices:
pair programming
TDD
continuous integration 


Historical remark
XP, late 90's, seems to have splintered / grown into various directions:
DEVOPS, with the focus on automation
Craftsmanship, with the focus on quality
LEAN, with the focus on delivering value
XP is not just the agile technical practices, it contains the seeds of later 'movements'. Nowadays that some of the early XP practices have grown into their own 'fields' it is easy to think that XP is just TDD and refactoring.
Out of the original proposed practices, some thinks caught on and are todays common ground, like 40 hour week and the short releases, some practices did not do so well like the on-site customer, and others have evolved into their own like continuous integration anf the CI/CD paradigm.


list of XP practices (1999 version - include graph for the relations between them )
on-site customer
metaphor
planning game
short releases
continuous integration
collective ownership
coding standards
pair Programming
testing
refactoring

40 hour week

What modern XP looks like
traditional practices
    on-site customer
    user stories
    test first
    pairing
    design improvements
    collective ownership
    continuous integration
    velocity
recent additions
    domain driven 
    UX
    support 
    learning 20%
    story prioritisation
    mobbing
    retrospectives
    continuous deployment 
    infrastructure

In other words, simultaneous continuous everything,

Continuous integration means trunk based development with feature toggles, or feature branches or minimal duration
