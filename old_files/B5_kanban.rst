What Kanban is about:

By managing queues, limiting work-­‐in progress and batch sizes and building a cadence through a pull system (limited WIP) versus push system (non-­‐limited WIP) we were able to expose more defects and execute more timely resolutions. On the other hand “pushing” a large batch of requirements and/or starting too many requirements delays discovery of defects and other issues; as defects are hidden in incomplete requirements and code.
